Global Python task
# ==================

Create a small Python application that provides a REST API of the provided JSON data. You may use any framework or libraries (or none).

The API should allow a client to perform the following:

- Fetch a single track
- Create a new track
- List the first 100 tracks in the order they were last played
- Filter tracks by name

Bonus:

- Allow the client to fetch a list of artists. Each item should contain the total number of tracks for that artist and their most recently play track.


We're looking to assess general Python ability and familiarity with APIs - there's no need to set up a full production grade stack.


**Tracks**
----
  <_Additional information about your API call. Try to use verbs that match both request type (fetching vs modifying) and plurality (one vs multiple)._>

* **URL**

  <_The URL Structure (path only, no root url)_>

* **Method:**

  <_The request type_>

  `GET` | `POST` | `DELETE` | `PUT`

*  **URL Params**

   <_If URL params exist, specify them in accordance with name mentioned in URL section. Separate into optional and required. Document data constraints._>

   **Required:**

   `id=[integer]`

   **Optional:**

   `photo_id=[alphanumeric]`

* **Data Params**

  <_If making a post request, what should the body payload look like? URL Params rules apply here too._>

* **Success Response:**

  <_What should the status code be on success and is there any returned data? This is useful when people need to to know what their callbacks should expect!_>

  * **Code:** 200 <br />
    **Content:** `{ id : 12 }`

* **Error Response:**

  <_Most endpoints will have many ways they can fail. From unauthorized access, to wrongful parameters etc. All of those should be liste d here. It might seem repetitive, but it helps prevent assumptions from being made where they should be._>

  * **Code:** 401 UNAUTHORIZED <br />
    **Content:** `{ error : "Log in" }`

  OR

  * **Code:** 422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTRY <br />
    **Content:** `{ error : "Email Invalid" }`

* **Sample Call:**

  <_Just a sample call to your endpoint in a runnable format ($.ajax call or a curl request) - this makes life easier and more predictable._>

* **Notes:**

  <_This is where all uncertainties, commentary, discussion etc. can go. I recommend timestamping and identifying oneself when leaving comments here._>
