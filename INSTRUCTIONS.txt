Global Python task
# ==================

Create a small Python application that provides a REST API of the provided JSON data. You may use any framework or libraries (or none).

The API should allow a client to perform the following:

- Fetch a single track
- Create a new track
- List the first 100 tracks in the order they were last played
- Filter tracks by name

Bonus:

- Allow the client to fetch a list of artists. Each item should contain the total number of tracks for that artist and their most recently play track.


We're looking to assess general Python ability and familiarity with APIs - there's no need to set up a full production grade stack.
